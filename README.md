# Project Description
ReviewMood is a PHP-based web application that analyzes the sentiment of user reviews and comments using machine learning. 
The system classifies text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral to help users and businesses easily understand public feedback. 
The application integrates a machine learning library through Composer and Packagist, demonstrating system integration and architecture.

# Machine Learning Library Used
- Library Name: PHP-ML  
  Packagist Link: https://packagist.org/packages/php-ai/php-ml  
- Purpose:  
PHP-ML is used to train and run a Support Vector Classification (SVC) model that performs sentiment analysis on user reviews.
It classifies text input as Positive, Negative, or Neutral, enabling real-time analysis of customer feedback.

# System Architecture
The web application is hosted on InfinityFree. Users access the system through a web browser, and requests are handled by the PHP backend hosted on the InfinityFree server.
The backend communicates with the machine learning module implemented using the PHP-ML library to analyze user input and generate sentiment results.
